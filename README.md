# dbus-battery-configs
These are the configs for dbus-serialbattery and dbus-aggregate-batteries that I use. They're well-tested and fine-tuned on my system. You might be able to use them for your reference, especially if your BMS is JBD UP16S series, but make sure to review them carefully and change any settings that don't fit your system before use.

USE_VEDIRECT_SMARTSHUNT_PORTS setting in the dbus-aggregate-batteries config works only with my fork https://github.com/dmitrych5/dbus-aggregate-batteries and won't have any effect otherwise.
